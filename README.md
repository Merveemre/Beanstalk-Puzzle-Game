In the Java back-end game project, the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are employed, specifically utilizing the SINGLETON and STRATEGY design patterns.
• The game is designed around a farmer (Man) character who is navigated through a maze. 
• The movement and manipulation of objects (bean, water, fertilizer, shovel) by the player to reach a target location are central to the gameplay experience.
• The project utilizes the "SINGLETON" design pattern to handle text files, which include map information, game control keys, and character details. 
• Every 10 moves, Man (farmer) gains new capabilities through the implementation of the "STRATEGY" design pattern. These additional abilities consist of "run," "pull," "slide," "strong push," and "strong pull" options.
