In the Java back-end game project, the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are employed, specifically utilizing the SINGLETON and STRATEGY design patterns.
The game is designed around a farmer (Man) character who is navigated through a maze. 
The movement and manipulation of objects (bean, water, fertilizer, shovel) by the player to reach a target location are central to the gameplay experience.
